Hi Dr. Lee,

 

As mentioned, we need your expertise helping us with identifying classroom usage trend to make recommendations of the plan of classroom moves with the expected new classrooms launching in Fall 2026.

 

Attached are two files:

In-person and Blended classroom usage over the last three Fall semesters.
Facilities lookup table for all three disciplines
All but 4 classrooms where says Draft Tables have computers
This file does not include the new classrooms currently being building on the first floor of Building 6, which need to be fully utilized.
 

Main goals to achieve:

The # of seat needs to be maintained, but the # of rooms can be reduced based on the analysis.
For Architecture: validate the need to add an additional classroom with 20+ drafting tables – this semester we “borrowed” 8217 as an overflown room for some architecture classes
Check if the # of Engineering classrooms meets the enrollment #s
For Technology
The master plan is to move all the classrooms in Building 2 to the 3rd and 2nd (if needed) floors of Building 6 – there are potentially 4 classrooms that can hold 40 seats
All classes currently held in Room 8216 will be assigned to the Cybersecurity/Networking classrooms on the first floor of Building 6


The main goal of this is to create an application that will analyze classroom utilization, classroom assignments at Miami-Dade College. You have the historical use and you have all of the rooms in the data in this folder. This needs to be intuitive. We're going to use Claude for the analysis and the Claude key is going to be in the .env file. We're going to need to have a very simple intuitive user interface. The output should be obvious and we need to have some insights and the ability for the end user to talk to the data through a chat type of interface. Thank you.
