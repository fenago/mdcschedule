# MDC Scheduling - Building 6 Planning Goals

## Primary Goals for Fall 2026 Classroom Reorganization

### Goal 1: Maintain Seat Count While Reducing Room Count
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Target**: Keep total seat capacity the same or higher while consolidating rooms
- **Current State**:
  - Building 2 rooms: 2128, 2129, 2130, 2132, 2133, 2134, 2135 (7 rooms)
  - Building 8 rooms: 8216, 8217 (2 rooms)
- **Proposed**: 8 new rooms in Building 6 (floors 2-3) + AI Commons
- **Key Metric**: Compare current vs proposed total seat capacity

### Goal 2: Validate Need for Additional Architecture Drafting Room
- **Status**: NEEDS VALIDATION
- **Context**: Room 8217 is being used as Architecture overflow
- **Question**: Do the Architecture sections in 8217 require drafting tables?
- **Current Drafting Rooms**: 4101, 4107, 4108, 6301, 6360 (5 rooms)
- **Key Metric**: Count Architecture sections in 8217, determine if they need drafting capability

### Goal 3: Check Engineering Classrooms Meet Enrollment Needs
- **Status**: NOT YET ADDRESSED
- **Question**: Are Engineering classrooms right-sized for their sections?
- **Action Required**: Analyze Engineering room utilization vs enrollment

### Goal 4: Move Technology Classes from Building 2 to Building 6
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Target**: Move Building 2 Technology classes to Building 6 floors 2-3
- **Proposed Rooms**: 8 × 40-seat computer classrooms on floors 2 and 3
- **Key Metric**: How many sections need to move, do they fit in 40-seat rooms?

### Goal 5: Move Room 8216 Classes to Cybersecurity/Networking Labs
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Target**: Move 8216 Cybersecurity/Networking classes to Building 6 Floor 1
- **Proposed Location**: New Cybersecurity/Networking Labs on Floor 1
- **Key Metric**: Count sections in 8216, identify courses
